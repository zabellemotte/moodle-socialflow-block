This tool has been developed to support students' learning and help them set goals for themselves on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The tool's customisation options are as follows: <ul>
<li> choose the reference period from 1 day to 2 weeks, to be personalised according to your relationship to deadlines,  </li>
<li> operate a selection of courses taken, to be personalised according to your expectations of each course, </li>
<li> display actions related to consultations (such as watching a video), contributions (such as submitting an assignment), or both, </li>
<li> choose the number of lines displayed in the block (from 5 to 100). </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
Some resources or activities appear grayed out in the list because they are configured with a restriction and you can not access them. Therefore, you should not take these items into account. </p>
<p>Teachers also have access to the social flow block with agglomerated student data.</p>
<p> The data recorded to display the social flow block is cleaned every night to keep only the data that is strictly necessary.</p>
